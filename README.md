Hello, this is my project for my exam and I would appreciate it if you could just mess around with it a bit then complete the form below.
There are a few ways you can do this, one is extremely simple but requires you installing and running an executable, while the other is better if you don't trust it but you will have to do a few things first.

--- Method 1 ---
Download the executable, then run the file. Experiment with it a bit and then complete the form at the bottom here.

--- Method 2 ---
Under the 'Code' button on the top right, click codespaces, then create new codespace. In the codespace, click 'install recommended extentions' when it prompts you to install python, then in the terminal, run `pip install flask` to install flask. Finally click the little run button in the top right corner, then ctrl+click on the port number underlined in the terminal. Then come back here and complete the form below.

Thank youu :)
