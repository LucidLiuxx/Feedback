Hello, this is my project for my exam and I would appreciate it if you could just mess around with it a bit then complete the form below.
There are a few ways you can do this, one is extremely simple but requires you installing and running an executable, while the other is better if you don't trust it but you will have to do a few things first.

# Method 1
Under the green 'Code' drop down to the top right, in local, click 'download zip' then run the executable within the 'Executable' folder. Do not move the csv files or executable file out of the folder when you do this.

It likely *will* get flagged for trying to 'Edit files on your pc' but this is simply the app writing to and reading from the 2 csv files within the Executable folder as these are where data is stored between sessions. If this puts you off, you may try method 2 instead.

# Method 2
Under the green 'Code' dropdown to the top right, click codespaces, then create new codespace. In the codespace, click 'install recommended extentions' when it prompts you to install python, then in the terminal, run `pip install flask` to install flask. Finally click the little run button in the top right corner, then ctrl+click on the port number underlined in the terminal. Then come back here and complete the form below.

# End
If you need any help with either method of running it please feel free to ask me for help :)

Thank youu <3
